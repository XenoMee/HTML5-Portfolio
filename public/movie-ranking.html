    <h1>The Best Movies According to Adrian</h1>
    <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time</h2>
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Avengers: Infinity War</h3>
            <p>
                The best movie I watched. 
                It's for the first time when the bad guy (Thanos) wins.
            </p>    
            <p>It gives an awesome experience by carrying you through different emotions.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Avatar</h3>
            <p>
                The first movie that revolutionized the cinematography industry being the first 3D movie.
                You get emersed into the world of Pandora and its nature by the beautiful colors and contrasts.
            </p>
            <p>The story is about the Naavi tribe and their endless war with the humans who are trying to destroy their home, Ewa.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Alien</h3>
            <p>The best Sci-Fi Horror movie from history. It features the most iconic figure on how an alien looks, the Xenomorph.</p>
            <p>The story is based around Ripley, a woman who works on a spatial station alongside her crew and has a mission to investigate what happened with the people on another planet, A6 454 - Xenomorph homeworld.</p>
